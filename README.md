# Practice_Constructor

This project demonstrates the use of constructors in C# by defining a `Baby` class with two constructors and showcasing their usage.

## Overview
The `Baby` class has the following properties:
- **`DateOfBirth`**: Stores the birth date and time.
- **`Name`**: Stores the baby's first name.
- **`Surname`**: Stores the baby's last name.

### Constructors
1. **Default Constructor**: Initializes the `DateOfBirth` to the current time and prints "Ingaaaa" to the console.
2. **Parameterized Constructor**: Accepts `name` and `surname` as parameters, initializes the `DateOfBirth` to the current time, and prints "Ingaaaa" to the console.

### Method
- **`Introduce()`**: Prints the baby's full name and date of birth to the console.

## Usage
- The project demonstrates creating `Baby` instances using both constructors and displays their details using the `Introduce()` method.
